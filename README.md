**Miedema Calculator** is a user-friendly application designed to calculate alloy formation enthalpies (energy) based on the Miedema theory and its derivative models, as developed by Dr. R. F. Zhang and collaborators. This tool is named in honor of renowned scientist Andries Miedema, whose empirical thermodynamic models greatly contributed to understanding metallic cohesion.

## Features
Miedema Calculator provides a comprehensive set of functionalities, including:
1. Displaying and comparing model parameters of elements.
2. Calculating formation enthalpies for binary transition metal compounds.
3. Estimating formation enthalpies for ternary transition metal compounds based on various geometric models.
4. Calculating the atomic size mismatch factor.
5. Computing the Gamma parameter and interfacial enthalpies for binary alloy systems.
6. Determining elastic mismatch enthalpies in solid solutions.
7. Calculating chemical enthalpies in solid solutions.
8. Estimating volume changes during alloying.
9. Evaluating formation enthalpies of amorphous alloys.
10. Providing a periodic table of elements with physical, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Screen Resolution**: Optimally 1024 x 768
- **License**: Free for non-commercial use

### Version
The current version, **4.0**, is applicable to binary transition metal alloy systems and alloy systems containing at least one transition metal element. Use caution when applying it to alloys with two non-transition metals or polyvalent elements like N, B, and C.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [official Miedema Calculator website](http://miedemacalc.weebly.com/).
